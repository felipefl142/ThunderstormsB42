Based on the context provided and your requests for specific changes to be made to certain files, here are some of the most likely candidates that would need changes based on typical development scenarios:

1. **Thunderstorms v2/Contents/mods/Thunderstorms/42.13/media/lua/client/Thunder_Client.lua**
   - This file contains Lua code related to client-side functionality, which might need adjustments if you're changing the greeting message in a way that affects how it's displayed or handled there.

2. **Thunderstorms v2/Contents/mods/Thunderstorms/42.13/media/lua/server/Thunder_Server.lua**
   - Similarly, this file contains Lua code for


#### Understand the project and answer what does it intend to do and how  

To understand the project and answer what it intends to do and how, I would need access to the specific files or more detailed information about the project's scope and functionality. If you could provide details on which parts of the codebase are relevant to your request for changes, that would be helpful in providing a more accurate interpretation and suggestion.

#### Explain how the two files: Thunder_Client.lua and Thunder_Server.lua communicate and work

To explain how the two files `Thunder_Client.lua` and `Thunder_Server.lua` communicate and work together, let's first consider their typical roles within a game or application where they might be used:

### Thunder_Client.lua (Client-Side Script)
This script is typically responsible for handling client-side interactions and visual elements related to the "Thunderstorms" feature. It likely includes functions that are executed on the client machine, such as creating overlays, managing visual effects like lightning flashes, and possibly interacting with server commands or events.

### Thunder_Server.lua (Server-Side Script)
On the other hand, `Thunder_Server.lua` is usually concerned with server-side logic, including handling requests from clients, processing data, and generating events that affect all connected clients. This script might include functions for calculating storm intensity, determining probabilities of thunder strikes, and managing shared state across multiple clients.

### Communication and Interaction
These scripts communicate primarily through network protocols (e.g., UDP or TCP) to exchange information. The client sends requests or data to the server, which processes this input and generates responses that are then sent back to the client. This interaction might involve:

1. **Client Commands**: The client script (`Thunder_Client.lua`) may send commands to the server indicating user actions or requesting updates (e.g., "create a lightning flash" or "request current storm conditions").

2. **Server Events**: The server processes these commands and generates events that are then broadcasted back to all connected clients, including visual effects triggered by the server on its side of the connection.

3. **Shared Data**: Both scripts might share data such as configuration settings or state information (e.
